<br>
In this website I have created a website on the Dodge Challenger Demon.
<br>
This website not only talks about the specific model but also talks about the other trims with the extra features that comes with each trim
<br>
<br>
The website has a navigation bar that changes color and also directs it directly in the same webpage.
<br>
These are the sections the website consist of:
<br>
-> Home 
<br>
-> Trims 
<br> 
-> Gallery 
<br>
-> Specs 
<br>
-> Colours 
<br> 
-> Performances 
<br> 
-> Contact Us
<br>
<br>
-> This screen shot is of the home page with a short note on the challenger and a small line with a small color transition on the text.

<br>
<br>
-> This screen shot is of the gallery section which is also similar to the color section.
<img src = "pic2.png">
<br>
<br>
-> This one is of the before and after transition of the NCAP ratings of the safety of the Challenger.
<br>
This is the before image:

<br>
And this is how it will look after we keep the curson on top of it:
